Format of files

PortalToPlatform.txt
---------------------

Each line of request has the PortalID (a single word) as the first token and 
a requestID (single word) as the second token, followed by one of the below
* Start
    should return the list of categories available, using category names from Globals.java
* List <Category> 
    where <Catgeory> is one of the category names in Globals.java
    should get back the list of products of the specified category
* Buy <ProductID> <numItems> 
    where ProductID was the value sent by the Seller earlier
    
Thus, a typical line in the file would be:
<PortalID> <RequestID> List Book
or
<PortalID> <RequestID> Buy seller1-book1 3
or
<PortalID> <RequestID> Start

PlatformToPortal.txt
---------------------

Each set of lines in this is a response to a specific request from a portal.
Thus, for each request, there would be an appropriate response:
For Start, the response should be:
<PortalID> <RequestID> category1 category2 ... (where categories are as in Globals getCategoryName()

For List, the response should be a series of lines, one for each product returned, where each
line has
<Portal ID> <RequestID> ProductName1 productUniqueName1 price1 quanitityAvailable1
<Portal ID> <RequestID> ProductName2 productUniqueName2 price2 quanitityAvailable2
...
...

For Buy, the response should be
<PortalID> <ResponseID> Success 
or
